/* okay so in this project, me n u arent gonna be making games on here but just fuck around and practice the locations and scripting
   aswell as using the coding knowledge you will have into such aspects of developing in unity
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
best way to memorize the functions is what ur gonna add here to remember like for example
transform - the location of the position, scale and rotation of the sprite

transform.translate(xyz) - the movement of a sprite

void update - like an loop
void start - happens the moment the game starts

something like that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
anyways here some parts tha id highly recommend you learning even outside of unity like in use of a console app

1. printing
2. variables like int, double and float
3. If statements
4, switches like booleon (true and false)
5. making functions

unity stuff id have learn if i can remember

1. the movement of an player using if statements

2. the transform location like making an teleportation, rotating and movement if an key is pressed

4. an movement of an object without using any keys, maybe an moving platform or a spinning object

5. collision detection in use of gameobject.collision or void oncollisionenter2d

6. collsion with use of triggers (void ontriggerenter2d)

7. an integer changing each action is made like for example, when the key F is pressed, int x will be added up by 1 but key G will decrease the number by 1

8. find any locations on the INSPECTOR that can be use as certain stuff to make like camera sizes and gameobject colors

9. UI and Buttons, same as 6, find an location that can be used as stuffs like the ui disabling and enabling

10. Buttons that have an function and will cause an action if pressed

11. audio scripting

12. raycasting


(before starting off scripting, id suggest fooling around with objects like creating an sprite, coloring and changing its appearances or maybe changing the size and location of the camera)
